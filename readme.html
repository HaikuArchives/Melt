<H1>Melt v1.3beta2 - Documentation</H2>

New in V1.3beta2:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Even more R5 fixes.
<LI>New image file feature completely disabled the folder->image feature, and thus
rendered Melt's main feature useless... why didn't anybody report this?! It doesn't
help anything to give the program bad ratings on BeBits without telling me what's wrong.
Anyways, fixed this bug.
<LI>Updated the <B>Usage</B> section of this manual, as always.
</UL><BR>

New in V1.3beta:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>R5 fixes.
<LI>You can now drop .iso/.img files. Worked nicely with the FreeBSD 4.0 release
ISO (bootable).
<LI>Several bugs squished.</UL><BR>

New in v1.2beta:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Audio CD mode: Drop RIFF WAVE files (14.4kHz, 16 bit, stereo) onto your Virtual Audio CD
Window and compose your own audio CDs with minimum fuss. Make compatible files with <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/152">SoundPlay</A>
or rip 'em with <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/518">cdparanoia</A>.
<LI>CDRW blanking tools: Check it out. Complete with a nice blinking status LED ;)
<LI>Various cosmetic enhancements. Thanks a lot to DOT for his <B>wonderful</B>
<A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/895/">icons</A> that I stole.
<LI>User friendliness enhancements.
<LI>And more!
</UL><BR><BR>
New in v1.0beta 3: Should not crash anymore on some folders. Also let's you drop
FAT32 folders, for example (via a trick, but that's no problem).

<H2>Introduction</H2>
OK. Said what had to be said.<BR>
<B>Melt</B> is intended to aid you with burning data (I might add audio support in
the future) CD-ROMs with <B>cdrecord</B> (&copy; J&ouml;rg Schilling) and <B>mkhybrid</B>
(&copy; James Pearson). Better try it out yourself.<BR><BR>
<H2>Requirements</H2>
If you haven't done so yet, please <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/547/">download</A> and
install <B>CDR Tools</B> (which include <B>cdrecord</B> and <B>mkhybrid</B>). Melt
probably crashes without them or causes other mayhems, I haven't tried.<BR><BR>
<H2>Usage (Finally)</H2>
Melt is designed to be easy to use. Almost everything should be self-explanatory - but heck,
here are some tips that might help you:<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>You have to drop folders onto a Virtual CD window. The name of the folder will be
the name of the data track. (That means, if you drop one folder, you'll have a CD that
contains the contents of that folder and has the same name.)
<LI>Always check if the size of the created image is OK. Always make sure you have enough
space on your HD for your image files.
<LI>If anything goes wrong while burning, please activate the Debug checkbox and send me
the log's contents <B>after</B> cdrecord has finished.
<LI>Better don't touch too much while cdrecord is burning. It's not healthy, believe me.
<LI>You can press the right mouse button on a track to pop up a useful context menu.
<LI>When choosing <B>Multisession</B> in the <B>New CD-R</B> window, please bear in mind
that this uses the cdrecord default track mode (it's XA-2 or something). It works in
BeOS, but I'm not sure whether Windoze, for example, will read your CD.
<LI>If you want to add more tracks to your multisession CD-R, open a new <B>Multisession</B>
mode <B>Virtual CD</B>, toss in your tracks, and burn it away.
<LI>If you want to close your multisession CD-R, do the same thing in <B>Single Session</B>
mode. If you just want to close the CD-R without adding more tracks, just burn a blank
<B>Virtual CD</B>.
<LI>The last trick can also be used to <B>Fixate</B> a broken CD-R, for example.
<LI><B>Fixate</B> in <B>Simulate Only</B> mode is just a waste of time, methinks.
